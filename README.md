# Fieldctl CLI

This cli aims to help on operating a local environment mainly for MacOS.

A developer usually needs to create ephemeral environments quick to develop, test and debug.

This CLI helps on making easy to create a VM with a k8s cluster in it and deploy vclusters.

[Vcluster](https://www.vcluster.com/) is a technology which allows to have multiple isolated k8s clusters within one "main" one.

Creating and deleting those vclusters is a matter of seconds. This helps on speeding up the development lifecycle.

## Use

The CLI is pretty simple and right to the point.

Download it and run:
```
<cli> --help
<cli> vm --help
<cli> cluster --help
```

### Dependencies

The binary is shipped with `vcluster` embedded.

The cli requires you to have installed `lima VM` and `kubectl`.


## DEV Notes

Why python? The CLI could have been developed using any other language. However, python is easy to read and develop even not having much experience.

As well, one of the packages is [pyinstaller](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller) which facilitates the creation of the binary.

This advantages come with the downside of execution time. In order to run, the binary creates a temporary folder in the filesystem to deploy the embedded resources like the templates and the binaries. This punishes the Development Experience.

- Work in progess
- No tests created
- Code is not polished

Fieldctl is built upon other open source code projects. Without these projects Fieldctl would never have seen the light.
